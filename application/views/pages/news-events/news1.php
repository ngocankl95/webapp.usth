        <div><b>Description:</b>The project Omics data analysis for human health and diseases in Vietnam (HealthOmics) is open for two interns, who may be in their second or third-year at ICT department, USTH. Candidates are expected to be interested in computational biology but not necessarily having experience in this field and will be trained where necessary.
            <br>

            <br> – Deploy Galaxy docker
            <br> – Find solution for data storage: MySQL/PostgreSQL
            <br> – Develop tools and workflows/pipeline for galaxy
            <br> – Document Helps and user’s guides
            <br> – Support and attend Galaxy training in class/summer school to be organized in Vietnam.
